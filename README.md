# UsingPy

This python package, will give you the C# Import Library combatibilty. 

C# Code:

```
using System
```
Python Code:
```
using(Sys, 1)
```

# Paramaters

The first paramaters is what package do you want. Such as OS, SYS, Pygame, TKinter. Or any other library. The second one has a default of no. The second one is asking if you want to import all of the files in that package. 

```
using(<Package>,<Import All?>)
```

###### Fair warning this is just the beginning code. 

### How to import?

As of now, I dont have the package up and running. So you can download the repo (GITHUB) import the python file. And use it like that.

I would like to have it like this.

```
import pyUsing
from pyUsing import *
```
